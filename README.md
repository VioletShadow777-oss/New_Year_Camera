Use this web app from:  https://iriram.itch.io/new-year-camera
(May not work properly with IOS and windows web cam, specially made and tested on Android Phone)

This project simulates the fire crackers in the sky. Dont need to support Unity AR foundation because I have used "Raw Image" to show what camera sees in the real world.
Just Open the app, click on the "Fire Cracker" buttons to see fire crackers in you sky, room or whatever your phones camera is pointing to.
Special addition is the "#Justice_For_Hadi" banner to maintain the scocial awarness that justice haven't been served yet (you can turn off the banner by clicking on the "Hadi Bhai Button" if you want to).
If you click photos with "Hadi Bhai Banner" it stays in the actual photo
